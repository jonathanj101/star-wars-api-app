# Summary

This project has been one of those fun project that i have built so far.I really enjoyed working with API (Application Programming Interface) and using Promises (ASYNC/AWAIT) to make HTTP request or calls to that specific end point or URL(Uniform Resource Locator).Then getting that data back as JSON format and using React to render those data to users for better readability purposes. Although, this project is complex to build at first, it has push me to dive deeper into React.js and it's "LifeCycle Methods" and how components are updated when first mount to the browser or when data is updated/changed. Challenging but promising in rewarding knowledge of how programming works when it comes to building applications.
